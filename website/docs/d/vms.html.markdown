# outscale_vm Data Source

Provides information about virtual machines (VMs).
For more information on this resource, see the [User Guide](https://wiki.outscale.net/display/EN/About+Instances).
For more information on this resource actions, see the [API documentation](https://docs.outscale.com/api#3ds-outscale-api-vm).

## Example Usage

```hcl

data "outscale_vms" "vms_01" {
  filter {
    name   = "vm_ids"
    values = ["i-12345678", "i-12345679"]
  }
}


```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `filter` - One or more filters.
  * `tag_keys` - (Optional) The keys of the tags associated with the VMs.
  * `tag_values` - (Optional) The values of the tags associated with the VMs.
  * `tags` - (Optional) The key/value combination of the tags associated with the VMs, in the following format: "Filters":{"Tags":["TAGKEY=TAGVALUE"]}.
  * `vm_ids` - (Optional) One or more IDs of VMs.

## Attribute Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `vms` - Information about one or more VMs.
  * `admin_password` - (Windows VM only) The administrator password of the VM. This password is encrypted with the keypair of the VM and encoded in Base64. You need to wait about 10 minutes after launching the VM to be able to retrieve this attribute. Once the password is ready, this attribute will appear in the Terraform state after the next refresh or apply command. Note also that after the first reboot of the VM, this attribute can no longer be retrieved. For more information on how to use this password to connect to the VM, see [Accessing a Windows Instance](https://wiki.outscale.net/display/EN/Accessing+a+Windows+Instance).

      * `bsu` - Information about the created BSU volume.

      * `link_nic` - Information about the network interface card (NIC).
         * `delete_on_vm_deletion` - If `true`, the volume is deleted when the VM is terminated.
